* Cumulative Grammar Definitions

As of §12.4 "Properties on Instances"
the current grammar definition is:

#+begin_src text

  # Not encoded in grammar: "break" must only exist
  # within the body of a "for" or "while" statement.

  breakStmt       → "break" ";"

  forStmt         → "for" "(" ( varDecl | exprStmt | ";" )
                     expression? ";" expression? ")" statement ;

  assignment      → IDENTIFIER = assignment

  equality        → comparison ( ( "!=" | "==" ) comparison )* ;
  comparison      → term ( ( ">" | ">=" | "<" | "<=" ) term )* ;
  term            → factor ( ( "-" | "+" ) factor )* ;
  factor          → unary ( ( "/" | "*" ) unary )* ;

  unary           → ( "!" | "-" ) unary
                  | call
                  ;
