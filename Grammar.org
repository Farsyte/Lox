  comparison      → term ( ( ">" | ">=" | "<" | "<=" ) term )* ;
  term            → factor ( ( "-" | "+" ) factor )* ;
  factor          → unary ( ( "/" | "*" ) unary )* ;

  unary           → ( "!" | "-" ) unary
                  | primary ;

  primary         → NUMBER | STRING | "true" | "false" | "nil"
                  | "(" expression ")" ;
