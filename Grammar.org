* Cumulative Grammar Definitions

As of §8.4.1 "Assignment Syntax"
the current grammar definition is:

#+begin_src text
  program         → declaration* EOF ;

  declaration     → varDecl
                  | statement
                  ;

  statement       → exprStmt
                  | printStmt
                  ;

  varDecl         → "var" IDENTIFIER ( "=" expression )? ";" ;
  exprStmt        → expression ";" ;
  printStmt       → "print" expression ";" ;

  expression      → assignment

  assignment      → IDENTIFIER = assignment
                  | equality
                  ;

  equality        → comparison ( ( "!=" | "==" ) comparison )* ;
  comparison      → term ( ( ">" | ">=" | "<" | "<=" ) term )* ;
  term            → factor ( ( "-" | "+" ) factor )* ;
  factor          → unary ( ( "/" | "*" ) unary )* ;

  unary           → ( "!" | "-" ) unary
                  | primary
                  ;

  primary         → "true" | "false" | "nil"
                  | "(" expression ")"
                  | STRING
                  | NUMBER
                  ;
